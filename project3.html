      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        This was a project I completed for CS4820, which had the goal of comparing the Divide & Conquer solution to the
        Brute Force solution of the closest pair of points problem.
        The BF approach is to merely check the distance between all the points, while the DC approach utilizes splitting
        the field of points in half, and then only checking points
        within a certain distance of the mid-line. As we can see, the BF approach does start off faster, but when N
        reaches about 500 points, the DC approach becomes signifcantly better.
