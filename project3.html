      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        This was a smaller, yet very insightful project that I completed for CS4820 (Analysis of Advanced Algorithms).
        This project addressed the Closest Pair of Points Problem, which is essentially finding the two closest points
        in proximity in
        a field of points.
        The Brute Force approach was to simply find the distance between all the points and each other, which takes
        O(n^2) time, and the Divide
        & Conquer approach was to split the points in half, and then only measure the distance between points that met
        certain criteria, which ultimately took O(nlogn) time.
        I then wrote code to graph the two function performances over time, and as we can see, the BF approach does
        start off faster, but when N
        reaches about 500 points, the D&C approach becomes signifcantly better.
