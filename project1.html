      <p>
        This was my final project for CS3110, which I completed with 3 other students. It took us about 3 months to
        write all the code and tests cases, and I was responsible for writing about 1000 lines of code. I mainly focused
        on developing the Player module and the Itemshop/Cutscenes.
        All of the code was written in OCaml, and we mainly utilized the Graphics module to create our game. Please look
        below to see images from the final product, including the item shop, the home screen, actual gameplay, and part
        of a cutscene!
