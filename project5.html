      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        These were a few of the projects I completed for my Comptuer Graphics class last semester. C1 involved building
        a particle system.
        C2 was a ray tracing project and also featured Constructive Solid Geometry. The Final was done in a group of 4
        and consisted of Toon Shading, Moving Camera,
        Particle Systems, and Terrain Alteration. All of these projects were done in Typescript and involved significant
        amounts of Linear Algebra. I also included some images from a practicum course I took that was associated with
        Computer Graphics.
        Our project was to remake Temple Run, and we remade it as "Henry on the Loose". The game featured a character
        made in Blender, and
        was made primarily in Unity using many of their built in tools, along with C# code for specific game
        functionality.
