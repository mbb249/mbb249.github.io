      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        This was the final project I completed for CS4410. Unfortunately, there are no striking visuals available;
        however, the project revolved around developing concurrent queues in harmony.
        In the first approach (as seen in the first two images), I created several methods that involved locks to add
        safety for concurrent edits to the queue. In the last photo, you can see
        I introduced notify() statements which were paired with conditionals to also create safety for concurrent edits,
        in a different manner.
