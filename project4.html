      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        This was the largest project I took on the involved concurrency, which made it a great final project for CS4410
        (Operating Systems).

        I completed this project with one other partner over the course of two months.

        Unfortunately, there are no striking visuals available, as the project revolved around developing concurrent
        queues in harmony.
        In the first approach (as seen in the first two images), I used locks to account for concurrency in the queues.
        In the second approach (the last two photos)
        we used notify() and wait() statements to account for concurrency. Both of these methods are equally effective;
        however, it was nice to see multiple approaches to solving the same problem.
